# Hi, I'm Darraneica!

**Problem solver. Always curious about coding.**

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub - where Python meets real life, and side projects turn into passion projects.

## All About Me:
- **IT GRAD** who loves writing code that *actually works*
- Python enthusiast - from scripts to full apps
- Front-end fan -- React & JavaScript to keep things lively

## What I Built
Here's a peek at some of my projects:
- **Clinical Project**
  *The Clinical Project was built using Python and SQLite. It is a simple healthcare management system that creates patient records and doctor appointments.*

- **The Sims 4 Mod Detector**
  *The Sims 4 Mod Detector checks for duplicates, bad mods/custom content, and flags any outdated/large mods/custom content.*
